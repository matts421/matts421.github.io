The privacy policy for the LLM Chrome extension app is as follows. By downloading and installing the chrome extension, you are agreeing to these privacy terms.

This chrome extension is part of a masters thesis project. The extension displays your ChatGPT usage on the site, and records your usage telemetry outside of the extension.

### Glossary
1. LLM: Large Language Model. This is a technical name for what ChatGPT is under-the-hood.
1. Token: a unit of measurement useful for LLMs. It is approximately a quarter of a character. The more you type to ChatGPT, and the more it types to you back, the more tokens you will incur.

### Data collection

#### Token counts
The application generates a unique random ID for you. The extension keeps track of token usage by this ID. Specifically, it records the token count and time of day the tokens were incurred. This anonymous process does not store any of your personal information; it is just used to see how different users of this application might adjust their token usage when using the extension.

#### Token goals
For the purposes of the study, whenever you update your daily token goal, this is also recorded. Again, this data is anonymized as your usage is assigned a unique random ID.
