As I enter my final semester of university, I have the chance to reflect on the time I've spent here at UBC. In doing so, I've realized that soon my brain
will no longer revolve around all-things-student, and my college memories will begin to blur. So, while all the information is still (pseudo) fresh, I need to create
a proper digest of my physics degree. Honouring this theme, let's do this in the nerdiest and most physics-y way possible: with a **tierlist**.

Of course, every good tierlist needs a rubric. Here are things I _do_ consider for each ranking:

1. _Usefulness._ How useful is the course for post-school life?
2. _Execution._ Given what the course sets out to do, how well does it accomplish this?
3. _Organization._ Are the topic and quantity of the course content reasonable?

Let me lead with a forewarning; these are things I absolutely _do not_ consider for each ranking:

1. _Professor._ Teaching staff often changes, and it is not my intention to use this platform to provide performance reviews of faculty.
2. _Grades._ Including this metric skews the rankings to not properly reflect the true learning takeaways of a course.

Here's the list<sup>1</sup>:

<Tierlist ranks={
  {
    "S": ["PHYS 410", "MATH 400", "PHYS 449", "PHYS 402", "PHYS 409", "MATH 317"],
    "A": ["PHYS 403", "PHYS 210", "PHYS 309", "PHYS 216", "SCIE 001", "MATH 316"],
    "B": ["PHYS 401", "PHYS 229", "PHYS 474", "MATH 221", "MATH 215"],
    "C": ["PHYS 407", "PHYS 306", "MATH 300", "MATH 318"],
    "D": ["PHYS 200", "PHYS 203", "MATH 200", "PHYS 301"],
    "F": ["BIOL 140", "PHYS 219", "PHYS 304"]
  }
}/>

<sup>1</sup> The astute reader will note the inclusion of some non-physics courses in this list. All math courses listed are required for an
honours physics degree. First-year science courses (here SCIE 001 and BIOL 140) were also included because the physics specialization does not
begin until second year.
