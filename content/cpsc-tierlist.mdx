Having now completed my Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) degree at UBC, I must commemorate my time learning CPSC. Given my previous blog post, I thought it would only be fair to
give CPSC and PHYS the same treatment, so I'm back with another **tierlist**.

The evaluation criteria will be identical to that of the physics tierlist. For the sake of brevity, I will not include such criteria here,
so I encourage the reader to read my previous tierlist before this post.

Also, this list is in no way related to my previous list; a full ranking of the courses I've taken at UBC would _not_ simply be a rank-wise union of these two lists.

Here's the list:

<Tierlist
  ranks={{
    S: ["CPSC 427", "CPSC 340", "CPSC 416"],
    A: ["CPSC 210", "STAT 305", "CPSC 320", "CPSC 312", "CPSC 317"],
    B: ["CPSC 213", "CPSC 221", "MATH 220", "CPSC 313", "CPSC 418"],
    C: ["CPSC 304", "CPSC 314", "CPSC 303"],
    D: ["STAT 306", "CPSC 310", "CPSC 455"],
    F: ["STAT 404", "CPSC 404"],
  }}
